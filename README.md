  The above link contains a description of the project and provides files needed to complete the project. The folder `train` contains all the dog images that needs to 
  be trained on.
  
 ##Running this:
  If you want to run this on your own:
      - Make sure you use Google Colab if you do not have your own computer with a dedicated GPU. If using Google Colab, make sure you run this on a GPU provided by Google services under the Runtime option.
      - Make sure your save the the train,test and labels folder under the path `content/drive/MyDrive/Dog Vision/` so the code can run without altering the code.
